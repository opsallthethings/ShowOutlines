Main Topic
----------
Development and the SysAdmin

* Guess What?  You're a Developer!
  * Those scripts you were writing?  That's code.
  * We need to treat those scripts with the same care and concern that developers treat code
  * Our infrastructure is as important as app code developers write
* Why Should I Care?
  * It's getting easier and easier to outsource specific applications (SaaS) and infrastructure (IaaS)
  * Business is watching - PuppetLabs 2014 State of DevOps report / Gartner
  * If our perceived value SysAdmins + Licensing + Hardware == Service Provider, then 
  * We must show business value (check out our previous show)
  * Providing as good/better options internally compared to public offerings
  * Where we can't compete internally, make effective use of public offerings and help the business evaluate that position.
  * If we can't offer the ability to compose those services and platforms, someone else will.. and at the end of the day, business needs to get things done.
* Now What?
  * Source control (check out our previous show)
  * Debugging skills (check out our previous show)
  * Testing (unit/integration/acceptance)
  * Refactoring
  * Design Patterns
  * Pair programming
