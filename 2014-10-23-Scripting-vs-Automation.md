Main Topic
----------
Scripting vs Automation

Scripting and automation are two things that are discussed almost synonomously, but they are not.

- Tools are
  - Scripts or programs that take a multi-step process and consolidate them to fewer steps

- The benefit of tools
  - Standardization of process
  - Less re-inventing the wheel
  - Allows ops folks to deal with repeat issues faster

- Automation is  
  - Creating a system to elimate the task
  - Taking the tooling and surfacing it to consumers

- The benefit of Automation
  - Ops becomes a service provider 
  - Requirement to scale
    - Tools are still dependent on operations time to run and shepard the results
    - Automation makes it possible for consumers to execute the task on their schedule
