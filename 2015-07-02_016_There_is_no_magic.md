Main Topic
----------

### There is no magic...

- Most things don't "just work"
  - Environments are different
  - Performance requirements are different
  - Data is different
- At the end of the day, ops folks need to know how things work
  - Why is that network connection failing?
  - Why can't my application talk to the sql server?
  - What is the lifecycle of the application after a web request comes in?
  - What is a service - really?
  - etc...
- Tools can cover over some lack of understanding
  - But things break, and we have to get them fixed again
  - Vendors often shuffle blame
  - Lack of understanding about what a tool covers over leads to ineffecient use of the tool
- There is no subsitute for knowledge and experience
  - Installing a tool does not make you an expert
    - Knowing how to tweak and tune for your environment does
  - You need to know the behavior of services you interact with as well
- So, how do I get started with "x"?
  - Let me google that for you....
  - Grab the docs or a book and try to make something work
  - Break it and try to find what errors get logged and try to fix it
