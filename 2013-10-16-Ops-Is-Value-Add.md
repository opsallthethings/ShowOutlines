Main Topic
----------

(*Steve* Introduces the topic)

Perceptions of Operations - Cost Center or Value Add

### Talking points

* *Chris* Means of production
  * Idea here really being that the company doesnt function without IT
  * Discussion about email, auth, connectivity and basic infra
  * Business inteligence and providing useful services to users
    * Example: Chris' Dad and getting data from databases for business use
* *Steve* Many businesses do not realize how integral IT is until there is a failure
	* Even then, there is often change in perception of IT
	* Perceived as technical janitors, ignored and devalued
	* In this environment, there's not much upside for improving services, but there is a tremendous downside in having services go down
	* Stability is more important than innovation
* *Chris* Developer productivity
  * help devs find innovative solutions
  * keep them writing code and get services ready for them to play with
  * suggest ways to keep them from needing to write code because something like an LB will handle it
* *Chris* We hurt our own image
  * Mordac preventer of information systems
  * The IT crowd
  * Fake business value aka filtering
  * BOFH
  * Saying "no"
    * No from Ops mean No Ops
    * The pro-card is king
